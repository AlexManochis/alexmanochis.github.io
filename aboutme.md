title: About me
---

My name is Alex Manochis. I am a student in the school of Applied Mathematics and Physics of National and Technical University of Athens. I like mathematics and coding. Especcially, I am interested in numerical linear algebra and computational geometry. Last but not least, I love to implement complex and challenging algorithms.
